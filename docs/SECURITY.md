## Scope

Covers the `mailer` / `resend` settings sections, DSN and sender validation (`MailerDsnValidator`, `DsnHostGuard`,
constraints), the runtime transport and mailer decorators, the test e-mail and Resend key check, the sent-mail log
(recorder, repository, entities, purge / forget commands), the admin UI (controller, filter form, access listener /
checker, route loader), readiness (Twig, AuthKit adapter) and the configuration tree. It does **not** cover the host
firewall, Instance Settings' own storage, encryption and settings UI (see its SECURITY.md), the Symfony mailer
transports and provider bridges, or the content of the messages your application sends.

## Attack surface

| Input | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSN, sender, API key fields | Instance Settings section form / import (session, admin) | Validated by the field constraints on save **and** import; secrets encrypted at rest by Instance Settings. |
| Admin HTTP `GET` (session) | `…/log`, `…/log/{id}`, `…/log/{id}/body` | Access checker on every request under the prefix; UUID route requirement; `no-store`; `sort` / `dir` checked against a whitelist (never interpolated into DQL). |
| Admin HTTP `GET` (session) | `…/log/export` | Same access as the list plus optional `web_ui.export.access_roles`; formula-injection guard on every cell (`CsvSafeWriter`, best effort for common spreadsheets); `no-store`; capped at `web_ui.export.max_rows`; bodies only with `log.store_bodies` + `web_ui.export.include_bodies` + `?bodies=1`. |
| Admin HTTP `POST` (session) | `…/actions/test`, `…/actions/resend/check`, `…/actions/resend/test` | CSRF-only Form, MailKit access **and** Instance Settings section access, per-user rate limit for test e-mails. |
| Outbound SMTP / provider API | `RuntimeTransport` | Only to validated DSNs (scheme allow-list, host guard); framework `MAILER_DSN` fallback trusted. |
| Outbound HTTPS | `ResendApiChecker` → `https://api.resend.com/domains` | Fixed URL, deadline, no redirects. |
| DNS | `DsnHostGuard` | Bounded child-process lookup (`dns_timeout`). |
| Message content | `SentMailRecorder` | Envelope always, bodies only with `log.store_bodies`; internal headers stripped before delivery. |
| CLI | `nowo:mail-kit:log:purge`, `…:log:forget`, `…:send-test` | Operator input (no session). |
| Configuration | `nowo_mail_kit.*` | Validated at compile time; switches must be literal booleans. |

## Threat model and mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| **SSRF through the DSN query options** (CA M1: `?region=x@10.0.0.5:8443/` moved the Mailgun / SendGrid / SES API host) | Every query option is checked for every scheme: `region` only from a per-bridge allow-list (Mailgun `us` / `eu`, SendGrid `global` / `eu`, Scaleway `fr-par` / `nl-ams` / `pl-waw`, SES AWS region syntax; refused on other bridges), any other option value containing `@ / ? # : \\`, whitespace or control characters refused (credential options such as `session_token` may contain `/ + =`). Second line of defence: after the transport is built, its real endpoint host is read and must be a provider host (`*.mailgun.net`, `*.sendgrid.com`, `*.amazonaws.com`, `*.resend.com`, …) or pass the host guard. Regression tests replay the audit PoCs. |
| **SSRF through the DSN** (an admin points SMTP at an internal service or cloud metadata) | Host guard on every stored / provided DSN: cloud-metadata names and addresses always refused; `localhost`, `*.local`, `*.localhost`, `*.internal`, loopback, RFC 1918, CGNAT, link-local, unique-local, documentation and reserved ranges refused unless `allow_private_hosts` / `allowed_hosts`; host names resolved (A / AAAA) and refused when any answer is private or nothing resolves; IPv4 spellings normalised (OutboundUrlGuard `PrivateNetworkTarget`). Validation runs on save, on import, and before the transport is built at send time. |
| **Host command execution** (`sendmail://…?command=`, `native://`) | `sendmail`, `sendmail+smtp` and `native` are never accepted (not in the default list, refused in `allowed_schemes` at compile time). |
| **Silent mail loss** (`null://`) | `null` refused in the settings; a refused stored DSN fails the send (no silent fallback). |
| **Credential disclosure** | Transport failures are rethrown as `DeliveryFailedException`: a short message with a reference; API bridges answer "The mail provider answered HTTP <code>" — provider response bodies are never stored, flashed, printed or kept in the Messenger failure transport (no `previous`); the scrubbed detail is logged under the reference only. The scrubber masks the credentials of the DSN in use (user, password; raw, URL-encoded, base64), `username "…"`, `user:pass@`, `re_…`, `SG.…`, `xkeysib-…`, `key-…`, `Bearer …` and UUID tokens. DSN and API key are Instance Settings secrets (encrypted, never rendered back, sealed in exports); MailKit never logs or renders them: `MailerDsnAudit` labels (`scheme://host[:port]`), `[redacted]` invalid values in violations, `#[SensitiveParameter]` on DSN / key parameters, transport errors scrubbed (`user:pass@`, `re_…` keys, `Bearer …`) before they are stored, flashed or printed. |
| **Unauthorized access** | UI private by default (`ROLE_ADMIN`); empty role lists refused at compile time (pattern P1); a listener guards every request under the prefix and every bundle controller wherever it is mounted; actions also require the Instance Settings access of their section (its public `AccessGuard`); the token is trusted only when a firewall matched the main request. |
| **CSRF** | Every POST is a FormKit CSRF-only form (`csrf_only[_token]`, one token id per action); not submitted or invalid → 403. The container refuses to compile the UI without form CSRF or a token manager (pattern P2). |
| **Mail bombing / quota burn through the test action** | Per-user sliding-window rate limit, shared with the Resend key check (each check is an outbound call) (`test_email.rate_limit` per `rate_interval`, client address for anonymous demo access); recipient is the configured test recipient or the user's own address (no free-form recipient in the UI). |
| **Stored XSS through logged content** | Subjects, addresses, tags and errors are escaped by Twig; the text body is escaped in a `<pre>`; the HTML body is never inlined in the admin page — it is served alone with `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; img-src data:; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'; sandbox`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `no-store`. |
| **Injection** | ORM QueryBuilder / DBAL with bound parameters; LIKE patterns escaped (`!` escape); table names come from the configured prefix (validated `[A-Za-z0-9_]*`); the list / export sort is a key whitelist mapped to fixed DQL columns (`SentMailRepository::SORT_FIELDS`, unknown keys refused), never request text in `ORDER BY`. |
| **CSV / formula injection** (a subject or tag such as `=HYPERLINK("https://attacker.example",…)` run by a spreadsheet when an admin opens the export) | Every exported cell goes through ControllerKit's `CsvSafeWriter` (≥ 2.3.1): text starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR gets a leading `'`, and a trigger after an embedded `;`, `,`, tab, `|` or line break gets a space (Excel in `;` list-separator locales splits cells there and ignores the quoting); RFC 4180 quoting; regression tests with formula payloads in subject and tag, also read with `;`. This is a best-effort guard for the common spreadsheets (Excel, LibreOffice, Google Sheets), not a guarantee for every CSV consumer: treat the file as untrusted data when another tool processes it. |
| **Bulk personal-data exfiltration through the export** | Same access as the log plus optional `web_ui.export.access_roles`; `max_rows` cap (10 000, at most 100 000); no bodies unless three explicit opt-ins; `no-store`; can be switched off (`web_ui.export.enabled: false`). |
| **Log write breaking delivery / host transactions** | Writes go through DBAL (never the host unit of work) and are best effort (warning on failure). |
| **Accidental route exposure** | The controller is not autoconfigured; routes come only from the `nowo_mail_kit` loader, groups switched off are not loaded (REQ-SF-004 rule 7, integration test). |
| **Demo configuration in production** | `security.allow_unauthenticated: true` is refused unless `kernel.debug` is true. The demo publishes its ports on `127.0.0.1` only and sends to Mailpit. |
| **Cross-request state leaks (FrankenPHP worker)** | Only the transport for the last DSN is kept, reset on `kernel.reset` and on settings changes; see [FRANKENPHP-WORKER-AUDIT.md](FRANKENPHP-WORKER-AUDIT.md). |

## Admin UI exposure and allow_unauthenticated

The log shows who received what: keep `web_ui.path_prefix` behind the firewall (`access_control`) **and** the bundle
checker. `security.allow_unauthenticated: true` is a demo / local switch only; the container refuses it without
`kernel.debug`, but never set it in a shared or staging environment either. Restrict the mail sections in Instance
Settings (`nowo_instance_settings.security.area_roles: { mailer: [ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN], resend: [ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN] }`)
when not every admin may change the transport.

## Secrets and cryptography

- `mailer.dsn` and `resend.api_key` are Instance Settings secret fields: encrypted at rest with DoctrineEncryptBundle,
  never sent back to the browser, exported only sealed. MailKit adds no cryptography of its own.
- The decrypted DSN lives in memory only while a transport is built and in the cached transport object.
- Fixtures and the demo use obvious placeholders (`REDACTED-TEST`, `REDACTED-DEMO`); the demo key is generated at
  start and ignored by git.

## Personal data (GDPR)

- The sent-mail log stores recipients' addresses and subjects (needed to answer "was it sent?"). Bodies are **off by
  default** (`log.store_bodies: false`); when on, use `MailHeaders::redact()` for one-time links and codes.
- Retention: `nowo:mail-kit:log:purge` (default `log.retention_days: 30`) — schedule it.
- Erasure: `nowo:mail-kit:log:forget <email>` / `SentMailRecorder::forgetAddress()` deletes every row (and body) the
  person sent or received (to, cc, bcc, sender — matched on a normalised `recipient_index` column, so it works the same
  on SQLite, MySQL / MariaDB and PostgreSQL, also for addresses with `/` or non-ASCII characters) and masks the address
  in the subjects and stored bodies of the other rows (also URL-encoded). Internationalised addresses are accepted.
  Call it from your account-deletion flow. Not covered: copies outside the log (provider dashboards, mailboxes).
- `log.enabled: false` disables the log entirely.
- **CSV export** (`web_ui.export`, on by default for whoever opens the log): a downloaded file is a copy outside the
  retention purge and the erasure command. Limit it with `web_ui.export.access_roles`, keep `include_bodies` off, and
  record in your processing register who may export and how long files are kept. Bodies need three explicit opt-ins
  (`log.store_bodies`, `web_ui.export.include_bodies`, `?bodies=1`). Errors are scrubbed again on export.

## Logging

- `notice` "Mail settings changed." — section, field names, origin, redacted new transport, readiness.
- `warning` "Mail delivery failed." — redacted transport label and exception class (the message goes to the log row,
  scrubbed).
- `info` / `warning` test e-mail, Resend check (domain count / HTTP status), purge (days, count), erasure (count only).
- `warning` "Sent-mail log insert / update failed." — exception class only.
- Never logged: DSNs, passwords, API keys, message bodies, recipient addresses.
- `warning` "Mail delivery failed." carries a `reference` and a `detail`: the scrubbed transport message, which **may
  contain a provider response body** (with the known credential formats masked). Treat the application log as
  confidential; the body never reaches the sent-mail log, the flash, the CLI or the Messenger failure transport.

## Resource limits and timeouts

- DNS lookup per DSN host: `dsn.dns_timeout` (2 s), on save / import and when the transport for a DSN is built
  (once per DSN per worker until `kernel.reset` / a settings change). The readiness check (`isOutboundMailReady()`,
  AuthKit login page) never resolves DNS: syntax and configuration only.
- Resend key check: `resend.api_timeout` (10 s connect + total), `max_redirects: 0`.
- SMTP / provider sends: Symfony transport timeouts (DSN `timeout` option); keep them below PHP `max_execution_time`
  ([CONFIGURATION — Timeouts](CONFIGURATION.md#timeouts-req-runtime-001)).
- Stored bodies capped at 1 MiB each, errors at 2 000 characters, search at 120 characters, list pages at
  `web_ui.page_size` (≤ 200); purge in keyset batches; CSV export streamed (one row hydrated at a time; bodies loaded
  in chunks of about `web_ui.export.body_batch_bytes`, 8 MiB, instead of 100 rows of up to 2 MiB each) and capped at
  `web_ui.export.max_rows` (10 000, at most 100 000). On MySQL / MariaDB `pdo_mysql` buffers the whole row result in
  the client before the first line is written (a few KiB per row), so the peak memory of an export grows with
  `max_rows`; the connection is not switched to unbuffered mode because the body queries run while the rows are read.
  A fatal error in the middle of the stream leaves a partial file with status 200 (headers already sent).

## CSRF

Applies (session-authenticated admin mutations): FormKit CSRF-only forms on every POST action, fail-closed container
check, no `csrf_protection: false` on mutation forms (only the idempotent GET filter form has none). The CLI has no
session and no CSRF. The CSV export is a GET read with no side effect (same as the filters): no CSRF token; a forged
cross-site link can only make the admin's own browser download what it may already read, never cached (`no-store`).

## Dependencies and updates

- Runtime dependencies: Symfony components (mailer, form, validator, security-csrf, rate-limiter, http-client…),
  Doctrine, Instance Settings, UiKit, FormKit, OutboundUrlGuard, Twig Extra. CI runs `composer audit --locked` on every
  matrix cell; Dependabot groups Composer, npm (demo e2e) and GitHub Actions updates.
- Security fixes are released as patch versions and noted in the changelog.

## Residual risks and host guidance

- **I9 — DNS rebinding / TOCTOU.** The host is resolved when the DSN is validated; the transport resolves it again when it
  connects. A host that changes its answer after validation could still reach a private address. Use IP-literal or
  provider DSNs for strict environments, or an egress firewall.
- **`allowed_hosts` / `allow_private_hosts`** turn the guard off for those hosts: list only relays you operate.
  Single-label names (`mailpit`, `redis`) are refused unless allow-listed, with or without `resolve_dns` (CA I2);
  `allow_private_hosts: true` accepts them.
- **I5 — HTML body viewer.** The stored HTML body is served alone with a sandboxing CSP (no script, no forms, no remote
  loads); a click on a link inside it still navigates the tab (normal for an e-mail viewer).
- **I6 — test e-mail content.** The test e-mail names the redacted transport (`smtp://host:port`) and goes to the
  configured test recipient, which any admin of the section may set to an external address (rate-limited, fixed
  content).
- **I8 — demo tooling.** The Playwright screenshot converter (`sharp`, dev only, not shipped) may carry upstream
  image-library advisories; it never processes untrusted images.
- **R3 — case and accent folding.** Subject / body erasure matches with SQL `LOWER()`: on SQLite it folds ASCII only (an
  upper-case non-ASCII address in a subject may survive the masking — the rows addressed to the person are still deleted
  through the normalised index), and MySQL / MariaDB accent-insensitive collations (`*_ai_ci`) may match more rows than
  the exact address (`jose@` also matches `josé@`): erasure then deletes / masks more, never less.
- **TLS checks.** `verify_peer=0` / `verify_peer_name=0` in a stored DSN are refused unless `dsn.allow_insecure_tls: true`
  (development only).
- **I10 — log visibility.** Every user who passes the MailKit access checker sees every log row (an admin log, no
  per-row ownership); Instance Settings `area_roles` for `mailer` restrict the settings, not the log — use
  `security.access_roles` / `access_checker` for that.
- **Admins choose the transport.** A user who may edit the `mailer` section can route all mail (including password
  resets) through a server they control. Restrict the section with Instance Settings `area_roles` and audit the
  `Mail settings changed.` notices.
- **Framework fallback.** `MAILER_DSN` is not validated (ops configuration).
- **Recipients in the log** are personal data even without bodies: protect the UI, purge, honour erasure requests.
